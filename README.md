# My iOS notes

Several documents that I maintain for myself. I just can't remember how to do the things I want to do. Maybe they can help you too. 

You can find [my Android notes here](https://github.com/dfreniche/android-documentation)

These docs are in Markdown format, prepared to be used with the superb presentation software [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/)
