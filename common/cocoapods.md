# CocoaPods

https://cocoapods.org/

---

## The traditional* approach to library management

###  like in "traditional" == bad

* write your code
* find some libraries on StackOverflow
* download them from github
* unzip & add to your project
* _which folder do I have to add to my project?_
* try to keep that mess organized
* ... good luck with that 


---

# What if...?

* there's a new version of your libs with more features?
* there's a fixed bug you don't know about?
* __GOTO Traditional approach__

# Install Cocoa Pods

- this installs the CocoaPods application
- CocoaPods is a Ruby gem
- do the same to update Cocoa Pods

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

---

## Check installation

```
$ pod --version
```

---

## Creating a Podfile

```
pod init
```

### Errors?

```
LoadError - cannot load such file -- nanaimo

$ gem list | grep nanaimo
$ sudo gem uninstall nanaimo 0.2.2
```

---

## The Podfile

- Ruby syntax file
- # start of Comment

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks! # Comment this if you're not using Swift 
                # and don't want to use dynamic frameworks

#inhibit_all_warnings!

project 'MyApp.xcodeproj'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 2.6'
  pod 'ORStackView', '~> 3.0'
  pod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 2.3'
end
```

---

## Advanced Podfile

```ruby

# we can put commond pods inside a def
def common_pods
    # Get the latest version
    pod 'Realm'             
    
    # Get exactly that version (version number is a tag inside git repo)
    pod 'BugfenderSDK', '~> 0.3.22'
    
    # Get the last commit of that branch
    pod 'XMPPFramework', :git => "https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework.git", :branch => 'master'

    # Get one specific commit from that repo
    pod 'Haneke', :git => 'https://github.com/mobilejazz-contrib/Haneke.git', :commit => 'f086dced38610b45c848b2e0163f11e24247f671'
end #common pods

def testing_pods
    pod 'Kiwi'
end

target :MyApp do
    common_pods
end

target :MyAppTests do
    testing_pods
end

```

---

## Install pods

- Install project dependencies according to versions from a Podfile.loc
- creates a Workspace
    - __use the workspace!__

```bash
$ pod install

Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project
...
```

---

## Update / add / remove pods

1. edit Podfile
1. run `pod install` again

---


## Finding Pods

- https://cocoapods.org/
- pod search
    - `$ pod search Hermod`
- https://www.cocoacontrols.com/ ðŸ˜‡

---

## Podfile.lock

- stores meta info for CocoaPods
- all version numbers for used libraries

```
PODS:
  - Realm (2.0.3):
    - Realm/Headers (= 2.0.3)
  - Realm/Headers (2.0.3)

DEPENDENCIES:
  - Realm

SPEC CHECKSUMS:
  Realm: 5f008bfe3c8c47142eddfc30b8c1584cde22db24

PODFILE CHECKSUM: 8bdaa34b0d4243cb9885db87f133bd1ada0c709c

COCOAPODS: 1.2.0
```

---

## What should I commit to my repo?

- at least Podfile + Podfile.lock
- IMHO everything else
    - build in one step, without the need to run `pod install` after clone
    - repos can dissapear

---

## Restart "fresh"

- removes everything in your project regarding CocoaPods

```bash
pod deintegrate
(optional) rm -rf Pods
```

--- 

## Alternatives

- manual git submodules
- Carthage (https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
    - decentralized
